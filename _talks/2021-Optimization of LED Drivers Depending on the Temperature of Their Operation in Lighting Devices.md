"Optimization of LED Drivers Depending on the Temperature of Their Operation in Lighting Devices." IEEE 3rd Ukrainian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering (UKRCON). 266 - 271. doi: [10.1109/UKRCON53503.2021.9575876](https://doi.org/10.1109/UKRCON53503.2021.9575876). 

In the article, the influence of ambient temperature on such parameters of LEDs as forward and reverse current, forward voltage, luminous flux, service life was analyzed.-The model of the change in the parameters of LEDs from the ambient temperature has been builded. Recommendations on the choice of the LED operating mode depending on the temperature have been submitted.
