IEEE 2nd Ukraine Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering UKRCON-2019. 314 â€“ 320. doi: [10.1109/UKRCON.2019.8879985](https://doi.org/10.1109/UKRCON.2019.8879985). 

This article proposes an approach towards combating power meters tampering by manipulation with strong magnetic fields. The vulnerabilities of electronic power meters are highlighted, and different shielding structures for limiting electromagnetic interference on power meters are investigated. Simulations were performed using the CST EM Studio simulation tool, exploiting the finite element method. The techniques for optimization of shield's dimensions and shape are studied.
