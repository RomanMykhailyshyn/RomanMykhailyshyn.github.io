Abstract: The article considers the usage light-emitting-diode lamps in decorative lighting. The possibility of adjusting the brightness of the illumination of LED lamps, which do not have an integrated controller of regulating process of luminous flux, is considered. The electric circuit of the lighting system is proposed. The limits of voltage and current regulation are calculated. The estimation of the quality of electric energy input is given.
