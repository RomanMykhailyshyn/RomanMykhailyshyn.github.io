Abstract: This article presents the advantages of using Bernoulli gripping devices in the transport and loading systems of the automated production. It provides the modeling of air flow dynamics in a nozzle and in a radial interval between the interacting surfaces of Bernoulli gripper and object of transportation. For this purpose we use averaging on RANS equation of dynamics of viscous gas, SST-model of turbulence and γ-model of laminar and turbulent transition. As a result of the study, this paper offers options of constructive improvement of a nozzle form and conditions for the analysis of energy efficiency of Bernoulli gripper. The theoretical contribution of this paper is that, as a result of numerical modeling in the program Ansys-CFX environment, the influence of the nozzle form in the Bernoulli gripping devices’ on its carrying power, account characteristics, and energy efficiency has been determined.
