Abstract: In this article influence of force of frontal resistance of air, acting on object of manipulation in the course of its transportation on a rectilinear trajectory, on the necessary loading capacity of Bernoulli gripping device is analyzed. The analytical dependences are provided for calculation of force of frontal resistance of air considering orientation of an object of manipulation during transportation. The main consistent patterns of influence of speed of transportation of an object of manipulation and its dimensions on force of frontal resistance of air are determined. Need of accounting for design models influence of forces of frontal resistance of air when determining the minimum necessary lifting force of Bernoulli gripping device is proved.
