Abstract: The contactless transport of a flat object with a displaced center of mass by means of the Bernoulli gripper is considered. When shifting the center of mass of the object of manipulation relative to the axis of the Bernoulli gripping device, there is a deviation from the parallelism between their active surfaces in the static position. For this case, we propose formulas for calculating the distribution of air pressure in the radial gap between the active surfaces of the Bernoulli gripper and the object of manipulation. The results of calculations of the distribution of rarefaction on the surface of the object of manipulation have shown that the asymmetry of the distribution depends on the magnitude of the displacement of the object's center of the mass. The method of calculating the force and torque associated with the action of the Bernoulli gripper on the object of manipulation is proposed.
