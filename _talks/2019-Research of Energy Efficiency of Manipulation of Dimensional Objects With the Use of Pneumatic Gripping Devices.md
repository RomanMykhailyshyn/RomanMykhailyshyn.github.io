Abstract: The process of manipulation of dimensional objects without optimization and with orientation of optimization gripping systems is investigated. The comparative analysis of energy efficiency of transportation of dimensional objects with orientation optimization gripping systems on the basis of vacuum, vortex and Bernoulli gripping devices is carried out. The efficiency of use of a method of optimization of orientation gripping systems on the basis of pneumatic gripping devices is proved.
