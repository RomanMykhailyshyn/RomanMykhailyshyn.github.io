## Description
The main idea of the project is the design of grippers that imitate (bio-inspire) the mechanisms or functions of the existing grasping methods in nature, which, thanks to evolution, have achieved significant success for certain tasks and objects.

## Funding
The project partially funded by grant "Disassembly plans that take into account the mechanical and dynamic characteristics of the robot/implementation of disassembly application" from fund [New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO)](https://www.nedo.go.jp/english/). Other part of the project was partially funded by [Texas Robotics](https://robotics.utexas.edu/) AIP Research Fund Award “Dexterous Fingers for Delicate Grasping with Low Contact Capabilities”.
