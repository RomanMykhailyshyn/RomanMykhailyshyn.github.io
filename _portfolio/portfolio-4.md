## Description
The main idea of the project is the development of new types of grasping systems and methods of their use for medical purposes, in order to minimize tissue damage and contact with them.

## Funding
The project is in the process of seeking funds from NSF FRR.

## Colaboration
* National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (Japan).
* Texas Robotics, The University of Texas at Austin (USA).
* Walker Department of Mechanical Engineering, The University of Texas at Austin (USA).
* EPAM School of Digital Technologies, American University Kyiv (Powered by Arizona State University) (Ukraine).

## Results

The first step is the development of a low-contact gripper that would be able grasping and manipulate soft objects with different surface shapes. For example, during surgical applications, manipulation of various organs with convex and concave surfaces.
