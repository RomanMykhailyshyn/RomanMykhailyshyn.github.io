The article deals with the topical issue of reducing energy consumption for transportation of industrial objects. The energy efficiency of the process of objects manipulation with the use of the orientation optimization method while gripping with the help of different methods has been studied. The analysis of the influence of the constituent parts of inertial forces, that affect the object of manipulation, on the necessary force characteristics and energy consumption of Bernoulli gripping device has been proposed. The economic efficiency of the use of the optimal orientation of Bernoulli gripping device while transporting the object of manipulation in comparison to the transportation without re-orientation has been proved.
