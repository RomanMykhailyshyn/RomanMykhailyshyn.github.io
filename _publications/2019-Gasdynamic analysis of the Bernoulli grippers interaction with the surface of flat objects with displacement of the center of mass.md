The contactless transport of a flat object with a displaced center of mass by means of the Bernoulli gripper is considered. When shifting the center of mass of the object of manipulation relative to the axis of the Bernoulli gripping device, there is a deviation from the parallelism between their active surfaces in the static position. For this case, formulas for calculating the distribution of air pressure in the radial gap between the active surfaces of the Bernoulli gripper and the object of manipulation were proposed. Analysis of the nature rarefaction distribution on the surface of the manipulated object has shown that the asymmetry of the distribution depends on the magnitude of the displacement of the center of the mass of the object. The method of calculating the force and torque associated with the action of the Bernoulli gripper on the object of manipulation is proposed. The parameters characterizing the position of the object of manipulation to the Bernoulli gripper for various indexes of the object's weight and the coordinates of its center of mass are determined. The description of experimental equipment and results of experimental research is proved.
