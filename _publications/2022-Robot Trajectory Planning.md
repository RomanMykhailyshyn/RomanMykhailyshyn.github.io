he paper deals with the kinematic analysis of the robot model. The matrix method of kinematic analysis is used. The robot mechanism is an open kinematic chain. The position, velocity and acceleration vector of the end point of the robot arm is determined in the Matlab program. Computer simulation is also performed in the MSC Adams program.
