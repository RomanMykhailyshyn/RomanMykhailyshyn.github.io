The article provides a step-by-step justification of the parameters of the friction elements of the Bernoulli gripping devices with a cylindrical nozzle. The effect of friction element parameters on the lifting force of Bernoulli grippers with the classic design of the active surface and with the rounded-off nozzle and flat and toroidal surface is considered. Influence of friction elements location radius on grip lifting force is considered. Influence of friction elements shape on grip lifting force is considered. Effect of friction coefficient between friction elements of grip and object of manipulation on minimum required lifting force in order to perform handling operation is investigated. Influence of number of friction elements on Bernoulli grip lifting force is considered. For the grip design with the rounded-off nose and flat and toroidal surface when the elliptical friction elements overlap the end gap by 73%, the lifting force will increase by 7% in torsion with the lifting force without the friction elements.
