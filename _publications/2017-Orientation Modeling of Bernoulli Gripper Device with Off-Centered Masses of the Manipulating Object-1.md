The article presents the mathematical model for the calculation of the optimal orientation of the gripper device which provides minimal energy consumption for holding the object in the process of manipulation. The case of the transportation of the manipulating object with off-centered masses along the rectilinear trajectory taking into account frontal resistance force and inertial forces during the re-orientation is examined. The formula for finding out the minimal necessary attractive force along all the segments of the rectilinear trajectory has been deduced. Off-centered masses of the manipulating object forcing relatively to the symmetry axis of the gripping device and frontal resistance forcing on the necessary minimal attractive force of the object has been investigated.
