We were delighted to host Dr. Jinoh Lee from the Deutsches Zentrum für Luft- und Raumfahrt (DLR) German Aerospace Center for his talk: “Torque-controlled Humanoid and Locomotion Control in the German Aerospace Center.” Dr. Lee shared recent progress on TORO, the torque-controlled humanoid robot, and discussed advances in safe and compliant whole-body motion in unstructured environments.
