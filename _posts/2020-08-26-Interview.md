Before the pandemic started and when the borders were still open, Roman Mykhailyshyn, a PhD candidate at Department of Automation of Technological Professions and Manufacturing at Ternopil National Technical University, became one of the participants in the programme and interned at the National Centre of Robotics, Slovakia. Not only did it let Roman do necessary research, it also helped him to establish a collaboration with the Institute of Robotics and Cybernetics in the same city.

“After the programme two things were clear to me. First, international companies are extremely interested in Ukrainian scientific products. Second, sadly, Ukraine has much fewer capabilities for conducting scientific research.” He is now initiating talks with different companies to equip a robotics laboratory at his university. When asked about difficulties in any of the stages of the cooperation with House of Europe, Roman smiles. “Probably the biggest problem with the project for me is that I can only participate once. It really expanded the boundaries – not only physical but also psychological”.
