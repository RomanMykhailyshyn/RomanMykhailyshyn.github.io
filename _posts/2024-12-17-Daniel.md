It was a great pleasure to host Dr. Daniel Seita (Assistant Professor at the University of Southern California) who gave an invited seminar talk “Representations for Dexterous Robot Manipulation” for our Robotic Manipulation Lab (Osaka University), led by Prof. Kensuke Harada. A great discussion was held with key questions raised by Prof. Weiwei Wan and the students. Such exchanges of ideas in one area of robotics knowledge inspire further work and collaboration.
